# This project settings file works on three levels:
# - Private:    Can only be declared in this file and can not be changed in the application.
# - Protected:  These settings can only be read and maintained by administrators.
# - Public:     These settings can be read by anyone and maintained by administrators.
#
# Each setting has the following fields:
# - Category:   A string containing the name of the corresponding resource, object or view. If none is given, it uses "system".
# - Key:        A string with the name [a-zA-Z0-9_]+ of the setting
# - Value:      A mixed value, containing default datatypes, like strings, numbers, boolean and arrays.
#
# Declaring protected and public settings in this file overrides those defaults.
# Protected and public settings can be overriden by the administrator using the Settings resource of the API.
